# Weather Intelligence Service — Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

> **Status note.** Written before the product gained its conversational trip-planning interface, so it does not cover chat orchestration, destination disambiguation, or place discovery. The deterministic engine, data-design and testing sections still describe the core. For the current system see `docs/architecture/system-specification.md`.

## 2. Technical Overview

**Technical purpose.** Expose a versioned REST service that converts raw provider weather into a deterministic `WeatherIntelligence` object (risk, activity suitability, packing, best/worst days) for a location and date range, with an optional AI narration of that object.

**Service responsibilities.**

1. Ingest weather from pluggable external providers and normalize it to one internal model.
2. Persist raw readings and computed intelligence.
3. Compute per-day and trip-level intelligence deterministically from rule config.
4. Serve intelligence over a stable, versioned REST contract.
5. Optionally narrate a finished intelligence object in natural language, isolated behind a feature flag.
6. Cache to protect provider quotas and the hot path; degrade gracefully on any dependency failure.

**Design philosophy (the constraints every decision below serves).**

| Principle | Implementation consequence |
|---|---|
| Deterministic core is the product | All scores/ranks/recommendations come from pure functions over `(weather, ruleConfig)`; no I/O, no randomness, no LLM. |
| Clean Architecture (dependencies point inward) | `domain/` imports nothing from `infrastructure/`; enforced by a dependency-lint rule in CI. |
| AI narrates, never decides | Narration reads a finished object and writes only `narrative`; enforced by an AI-output test that diffs the object. |
| Two planes (Ingestion / Serving) | Serving reads the store; ingestion runs on cache-miss (MVP) or schedule (V3). Not every request re-fetches. |
| Fail soft | Every external call is bounded by a timeout + circuit breaker with a defined fallback. |

**Deterministic architecture & AI boundary (the non-negotiable).** The `narrative` field is the *only* field an LLM may write. Every other field is produced by the Insight and Recommendation engines and is reproducible for identical inputs. With the narration flag off, the service is a complete deterministic product and the full test suite passes. This boundary is structural (separate module, separate endpoint, separate test), not a convention.

---

## 3. Overall System Architecture

**Style.** Layered (Clean Architecture) monolith, split into two logical planes sharing one persistence boundary. A monolith is correct at this scope: no network hops between components, one deployable, trivially testable. The layering — not service decomposition — is what carries the extensibility story.

**Layers and dependency direction.**

| Layer | Contents | May depend on |
|---|---|---|
| Interface | REST controllers, DTOs, request validation, error mapping | Application only |
| Application | Orchestrator use cases (`GetWeatherIntelligence`, `GetBestDays`, `GetPackingList`, `GenerateNarrative`) | Domain interfaces only |
| Domain | Insight Engine, Recommendation Engine, Intelligence Builder, entities/value objects, ports | Nothing (pure) |
| Infrastructure | Provider adapters, Provider Registry, Normalization, Postgres repositories, cache client, LLM client | Domain interfaces (implements them) |

**Why inward dependencies:** the domain is the asset under evaluation and the thing that must be unit-testable with the network unplugged. If the domain imported a repository or an HTTP client, that property would be lost. Infrastructure implementing domain-defined ports is what makes providers, cache, and LLM swappable without touching business logic.

    end

```

**Service boundaries.**
- The service owns weather → travel-intelligence translation only. It does **not** own itineraries, POIs, budgeting, or destination knowledge (PRD §11).
- The only shared component between planes is the Knowledge Store.
- The Orchestrator is the sole component that knows execution *order*; nothing else calls out of sequence.

**Internal workflow (summary; full lifecycle in §5).** A request enters the Interface layer, is validated, and handed to an Application use case. The use case reads the Knowledge Store; on a fresh hit it runs the engines (or returns cached intelligence), on a miss it triggers ingestion, then computes. The Intelligence Builder assembles the response. Narration, if requested, is a separate call.

## 4. Component Design

**Component summary.**

| Component | Layer | Purpose | Pattern |
|---|---|---|---|
| REST API Layer | Interface | Accept requests, validate, map to use cases, shape responses/errors | — |
| Orchestrator | Application | Sequence the read/compute/build flow; the only order-aware component | Use-case / Facade |
| Weather Provider Layer (Adapters) | Infrastructure | Fetch + translate one external API into the internal model | Strategy / Adapter |
| Provider Registry | Infrastructure | Select active provider and fallback chain | Factory |
| Normalization Layer | Infrastructure | Validate + normalize raw provider payloads | — |
| Knowledge Store | Infrastructure | Persist raw readings + computed intelligence behind a domain port | Repository |
| Insight Engine | Domain | Per-day rules → risk → activity scoring | Pure functions |
| Recommendation Engine | Domain | Trip-level best/worst days, packing, aggregate scores | Pure functions |
| Intelligence Builder | Domain | Assemble the `WeatherIntelligence` object | Builder |
| Narration Service | Infrastructure | Optional NL restatement of a finished object | Adapter (behind a domain port) |

Detailed contracts per component follow. I/O is described at the type level, not as code.

### 4.1 REST API Layer
- **Responsibilities:** route requests; validate/parse DTOs; invoke the correct use case; serialize responses; map errors to the standard envelope and status codes.
- **Inputs:** HTTP requests (location id, date range, optional narration request).
- **Outputs:** JSON responses (intelligence, best-days, packing, narrative, provider health) or a structured error envelope.
- **Dependencies:** Application use cases only. No domain logic, no data access.
- **Interactions:** one use case per endpoint.
- **Implementation notes:** keep controllers thin — no branching business logic; validation is schema-driven at this boundary so malformed input never reaches a provider or the DB.

### 4.2 Orchestrator (Use Cases)
- **Responsibilities:** own the execution order (read store → compute or trigger ingestion → build); decide cache-hit vs miss; coordinate optional narration in the `GenerateNarrative` use case only.
- **Inputs:** validated request parameters from the Interface layer.
- **Outputs:** a finished `WeatherIntelligence` object (or sub-view) to the Interface layer.
- **Dependencies:** domain ports (`WeatherRepository`, engines) and infrastructure via DI — never concrete infrastructure classes.
- **Interactions:** Knowledge Store (read), Provider Registry (trigger ingestion on miss), engines (compute), Builder (assemble), Narration Service (only in `GenerateNarrative`).
- **Implementation notes:** the *only* place allowed to call `NarrationService`; this containment is what keeps AI isolation enforceable.

### 4.3 Weather Provider Layer (Adapters)
- **Responsibilities:** implement the `WeatherProvider` port; call one external API; translate its response shape into the internal weather model.
- **Inputs:** location + date range.
- **Outputs:** normalized internal readings (or a typed provider error).
- **Dependencies:** the external provider API; the `WeatherProvider` port.
- **Interactions:** invoked by the Registry; hands raw payloads to Normalization.
- **Implementation notes:** one adapter per provider; the adapter is the *only* place that knows a provider's dialect. MVP ships one adapter (Open-Meteo); a second is added in V2 to prove the abstraction.

### 4.4 Provider Registry
- **Responsibilities:** construct and return the active adapter and the ordered fallback chain; hold provider priority and active state.
- **Inputs:** location context / configuration.
- **Outputs:** a provider adapter, or a fallback chain iterator.
- **Dependencies:** provider adapters; provider config/health.
- **Interactions:** called by the Orchestrator on cache-miss; drives fallback on adapter failure.
- **Implementation notes:** Factory pattern; fallback ordering is naturally a Chain of Responsibility (V2) once a second provider exists.

### 4.5 Normalization Layer
- **Responsibilities:** validate raw provider payloads; map provider-specific fields to the internal model; reject/flag incomplete data.
- **Inputs:** raw provider payload.
- **Outputs:** normalized readings ready for persistence and compute.
- **Dependencies:** none beyond the internal model.
- **Interactions:** sits between adapters and the Knowledge Store on the ingestion plane.
- **Implementation notes:** completeness of normalized data feeds the `travelConfidence` computation (§7.5) — record which fields were present.

### 4.6 Knowledge Store
- **Responsibilities:** persist and retrieve raw readings and computed daily intelligence behind the `WeatherRepository` port; expose freshness metadata.
- **Inputs:** normalized readings; computed intelligence; query by (location, date-range).
- **Outputs:** stored records; freshness-checked reads.
- **Dependencies:** PostgreSQL.
- **Interactions:** written by the ingestion plane; read by the serving plane. The only cross-plane component.
- **Implementation notes:** Repository pattern hides SQL from the domain; stores `ruleConfigVersion` on computed rows so a rule change invalidates the right intelligence. Postgres doubles as the MVP intelligence cache via freshness check (§7.4).

### 4.7 Insight Engine (Domain)
- **Responsibilities:** per day — evaluate rule thresholds (Rules), aggregate into a risk level + factors (Risk), compute activity-suitability scores (Scoring).
- **Inputs:** normalized daily weather + rule config.
- **Outputs:** per-day `RiskAssessment` + `activitySuitability[]`.
- **Dependencies:** none (pure).
- **Interactions:** consumed by the Recommendation Engine and Builder.
- **Implementation notes:** Rules/Risk/Scoring are modules inside *one* engine, not three services. Every factor carries the rule id that produced it (explainability, NFR-1).

### 4.8 Recommendation Engine (Domain)
- **Responsibilities:** across the date range — rank best/worst days, aggregate the packing list, compute trip-level aggregates (`overallRiskLevel`, `tripSuitabilityScore`, `travelConfidence`).
- **Inputs:** the collection of per-day Insight outputs + trip metadata (horizon, provider agreement, data completeness).
- **Outputs:** the `tripSummary` block.
- **Dependencies:** none (pure). Consumes Insight output — must run after it.
- **Interactions:** feeds the Builder.
- **Implementation notes:** must not re-derive per-day risk; it composes Insight output. This ordering is a hard dependency, not a suggestion.

### 4.9 Intelligence Builder (Domain)
- **Responsibilities:** assemble the full `WeatherIntelligence` object (per-day + trip summary + metadata) from engine outputs; attach an empty/absent `narrative` block.
- **Inputs:** per-day Insight outputs, trip summary, provider/metadata context.
- **Outputs:** a complete, narration-free `WeatherIntelligence` object.
- **Dependencies:** domain entities only.
- **Interactions:** returns to the Orchestrator; its output is the read-only input to Narration.
- **Implementation notes:** the object it produces is the stable consumer contract (§7.5). It never calls the LLM.

### 4.10 Narration Service (Infrastructure, optional)
- **Responsibilities:** implement the `NarrationService` port; send a finished object to the LLM with a constrained prompt; return prose for `narrative.summaryText`; fail soft to a deterministic template.
- **Inputs:** a finished `WeatherIntelligence` object.
- **Outputs:** `narrative` block only (`summaryText`, `modelUsed`, `fallbackUsed`, `generatedByLLM`).
- **Dependencies:** hosted LLM API; feature flag; the `NarrationService` port.
- **Interactions:** called only by `GenerateNarrative`.
- **Implementation notes:** never writes any field but `narrative`; on flag-off, timeout, or error, returns the templated fallback with `fallbackUsed: true`. Named `NarrationService` (never "Advisor") to keep the boundary encoded in the vocabulary (§15, ADR-005).

---

## 5. End-to-End Request Flow

**Deterministic intelligence request (`GET …/intelligence`).**

1. Client sends request → Interface validates parameters.
2. Orchestrator queries Knowledge Store for fresh raw + computed data.
3. **Cache hit (fresh):** return stored intelligence (recompute only if `ruleConfigVersion` changed).
4. **Cache miss/stale:** Orchestrator asks Provider Registry for the active adapter → adapter fetches from the external provider → Normalization validates/normalizes → Knowledge Store persists raw.
5. Insight Engine computes per-day risk + suitability → Recommendation Engine computes trip summary → Intelligence Builder assembles the object → Store persists computed intelligence.
6. Interface serializes the object → `200` response. **No LLM involved.**

**Optional narration (`POST …/intelligence/narrative`) is a separate call**, never inline, so the deterministic path never waits on the LLM.

## 6. External Integrations

Only integrations defined in the Bible are documented: external weather provider(s) and the LLM. Both sit behind domain ports; the domain never calls them directly.

### 6.1 Weather Provider (Open-Meteo — MVP; second provider — V2)

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Source of current + forecast weather for a location and date range. |
| **Authentication** | Open-Meteo requires no key (chosen partly for this reason — zero-friction demo). A keyed provider (V2) uses an API key from environment/secrets. |
| **Request flow** | Orchestrator → Provider Registry → active adapter → provider HTTP call → raw payload → Normalization. |
| **Response handling** | Adapter maps provider fields to the internal model; Normalization validates completeness and flags missing fields (feeds `travelConfidence`). |
| **Timeout strategy** | Per-call timeout; on expiry the call is treated as a failure and the fallback chain advances. |
| **Retry strategy** | Bounded, minimal retry on transient network errors only; no retry on 4xx. Retries never stack with the fallback (retry the same provider briefly, then fall back). |
| **Failure behaviour** | Adapter raises a typed provider error → Registry advances to the next provider in the chain (V2) → if all fail, the request returns a degraded response. |
| **Graceful degradation** | With no fresh data and all providers down, return the last-known stored intelligence (if any) marked stale, or a structured `degraded` response — never a hang or 5xx crash. |

### 6.2 LLM Provider (narration only, optional)

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Restate a finished `WeatherIntelligence` object in natural language. Never computes. |
| **Authentication** | API key from environment/secrets; injected into the LLM client behind the `NarrationService` port. |
| **Request flow** | `GenerateNarrative` use case → Narration Service → LLM with a constrained prompt containing the object as structured data. |
| **Response handling** | Output written only to `narrative.summaryText`; treated as untrusted text; capped in length; never parsed back into a computed field. |
| **Timeout strategy** | Hard timeout; on expiry → templated fallback. |
| **Retry strategy** | At most one retry; narration is optional, so cost/latency of retries is not justified. |
| **Failure behaviour** | Any failure (disabled flag, timeout, error, malformed output) → deterministic templated narrative built from the same object. |
| **Graceful degradation** | `fallbackUsed: true` is set; the `200` still returns; no deterministic field is affected. |

**Provider-agnostic guarantee:** because both integrations are behind ports, prompt-injection in LLM output cannot reach a computed field (there is no write path), and a provider swap requires only a new adapter — no change to Application or Domain.

## 7. Data Design

### 7.1 Core entities

| Entity | Purpose | Key fields (level, not schema) |
|---|---|---|
| Location | Canonical place | id, name, coordinates, normalized key |
| RawWeatherReading | Historical/current normalized reading per provider | location, provider, fetched-at, valid-date, raw + normalized payload |
| DailyIntelligence | Computed per-day intelligence (cacheable, recomputable) | location, date, risk level, risk factors, activity scores, packing, advisory, ruleConfigVersion, generated-at |
| Provider | Registry state | name, priority order, active flag, last health check |
| NarrationCache (V2) | Cached LLM output | intelligence ref, text, model, fallbackUsed, generated-at |

### 7.2 Relationships
- A Location has many RawWeatherReadings (one per provider per date).
- A Location has many DailyIntelligence rows (one per date per ruleConfigVersion).
- DailyIntelligence is derived from RawWeatherReadings for the same (location, date) — but is stored, not recomputed on every read.

### 7.3 Persistence strategy
1. Store **raw** readings, not only computed intelligence — cheap, and it unlocks historical baselines/anomalies (V3) with no redesign.
2. Semi-structured fields (risk factors, activity scores, packing) persist as JSONB; queried fields (location, date, provider, risk level) are relational and indexed.
3. `ruleConfigVersion` on every computed row makes determinism auditable and invalidation correct.

### 7.4 Caching strategy (two levels)

| Level | What it caches | Location | Invalidation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Provider-response cache | raw provider fetches per (location, date) | Ingestion plane | TTL (freshness window) |
| Computed-intelligence cache | assembled intelligence per (location, date-range, ruleConfigVersion) | Serving plane | TTL **and** ruleConfigVersion bump |
| Narration cache (V2) | LLM output per intelligence identity | Serving plane | tied to the intelligence it narrates |

MVP uses in-memory + Postgres freshness checks (Postgres *is* the MVP intelligence cache). Redis is introduced in V2 only when cross-instance sharing or real eviction control is needed (§15, ADR-002) — not before.

### 7.5 Weather Intelligence Object (the consumer contract)

The Intelligence Builder produces this object; it is the stable contract external consumers depend on. Structure (from Bible §23), summarized:

- `location`, `period`
- `dailyIntelligence[]`: `summary`, `riskAssessment` (level + factors, each with a rule id), `activitySuitability[]`, `packingRecommendations[]`, `travelAdvisory`
- `tripSummary`: `bestDays`, `worstDays`, `overallPackingList`, `overallRiskLevel`, `tripSuitabilityScore`, `travelConfidence`
- `narrative` (optional): `generatedByLLM`, `summaryText`, `modelUsed`, `fallbackUsed`
- `metadata`: `providersUsed`, `ruleConfigVersion`, `generatedAt`, `cacheStatus`

**Aggregate-score semantics (kept distinct so none is redundant):**

| Field | Type | Meaning | Driven by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `overallRiskLevel` | categorical | worst-case: how disruptive the trip could be | max/severity of daily risk |
| `tripSuitabilityScore` | 0–100 | quality: how good the trip is for likely activities | weighted average across days |
| `travelConfidence` | 0–1 | certainty: how much to trust the assessment | forecast horizon + inter-provider agreement + data completeness |

**`travelConfidence` computation contract (resolving the Bible's open item — inputs are from the Bible; only the combination is specified here, and it stays deterministic and config-tunable):**
1. **Deterministic** — a pure function of three inputs; identical inputs → identical value.
2. **Inputs:** (a) forecast horizon (further out ⇒ lower), (b) inter-provider agreement where ≥2 providers returned data (disagreement ⇒ lower; single-provider ⇒ a fixed neutral factor), (c) data completeness from Normalization (missing fields ⇒ lower).
3. **Combination:** the three factors combine into a 0–1 score via weights held in **rule config** (versioned by `ruleConfigVersion`), not hard-coded. This keeps the field tunable without a code change and auditable across rule versions. The exact weights are an implementation/config decision, deliberately not fixed in this document.

### 7.6 Data lifecycle
1. **Ingest** on cache-miss → store raw reading.
2. **Compute** → store DailyIntelligence with ruleConfigVersion.
3. **Serve** from store while fresh; recompute on staleness or ruleConfig change.
4. **Retain** raw readings beyond the freshness window (fuel for V3 baselines); computed rows may be recomputed but are not deleted on read.

---

## 8. API Design

*(Design and contracts only — no OpenAPI/Swagger artifact, per the brief.)*

### 8.1 Endpoint organization (resource-oriented, from Bible §24)

| Resource | Operation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Raw weather | read | normalized readings for a location + range |
| Intelligence | read | full `WeatherIntelligence` object |
| Intelligence / best-days | read | trip-level best/worst view |
| Intelligence / packing | read | aggregated packing view |
| Intelligence / narrative | create | optional LLM narration (separate resource) |
| Providers / health | read | provider availability |

### 8.2 Versioning
- URI-based (`/api/v1/...`) from day one — cheap now, essential for a contract an external system depends on. A breaking change to the intelligence object requires a new version, guarded by contract tests (§13).

### 8.3 Request lifecycle
1. Route match → 2. Schema validation of params (location id, date range) → 3. Use-case invocation → 4. Domain compute or cache read → 5. Response serialization → 6. Error mapping if any step fails.

### 8.4 Response contracts
- Success: the relevant object/sub-view + `metadata` (including `cacheStatus`).
- Degraded success: valid object + a `degraded` flag and reason (e.g., stale data, provider fallback used).
- Narration: `narrative` block with `fallbackUsed`.

### 8.5 Validation
- **Input** validated at the Interface boundary (schema-driven): valid location reference, well-formed dates, sane range bounds; malformed input is rejected before any provider/DB call.
- **Output** conforms to the versioned intelligence contract; contract tests fail the build on a breaking change.

### 8.6 Error handling & status codes

| Condition | Status | Body |
|---|---|---|
| Success | 200 | object |
| Success, degraded (fallback/stale) | 200 | object + `degraded` |
| Invalid parameters | 400 | error envelope (code, message) |
| Unknown location/resource | 404 | error envelope |
| Rate limit exceeded | 429 | error envelope + retry hint |
| All providers unavailable, no stored data | 503 | error envelope (`degraded` reason) |
| Unexpected exception | 500 | error envelope (no internal detail leaked) |

Consistent error envelope across all endpoints: a stable shape with `code`, human-readable `message`, and (for degraded cases) `degraded` + reason, so consumers can distinguish "failed" from "succeeded with fallback."

### 8.7 API design principles
1. GETs are idempotent and cacheable by (location, range, ruleConfigVersion); narration is the only non-idempotent call and is itself cache-keyed on the object it narrates.
2. The deterministic endpoints never call the LLM — the resilience story is structural.
3. One error envelope, one metadata shape, everywhere.

## 9. Technology Stack

Only technologies from the Bible. Rejected options are listed where they were explicitly discussed.

| Technology | Purpose | Why selected | Trade-offs | Alternatives (discussed) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TypeScript / Node.js** | Service language/runtime | Matches the TravelOS reference code → zero language seam at integration; already in the author's toolset | Less native numeric/ML ergonomics than Python | **FastAPI/Python** — better validation (Pydantic) & auto-OpenAPI, but introduces a language boundary at the integration point; correct only if the platform were Python |
| **Fastify (or Express)** | HTTP framework | Lightweight; first-class schema validation → OpenAPI; thin controllers | Minimal | Express (also acceptable; no scope impact) |
| **PostgreSQL** | Persistence | Relational fit for readings/intelligence; JSONB for semi-structured fields; serves as MVP cache via freshness | Needs migrations; single-node at MVP | — |
| **In-memory cache → Redis (V2)** | Caching | Avoid infra you can't justify; Postgres freshness suffices for MVP | In-memory cache isn't shared across instances (fine at MVP) | **Redis from day one** — rejected until a concrete multi-instance/eviction trigger exists (ADR-002) |
| **Hosted LLM API (behind port)** | Optional narration | Swappable, isolated, optional | External cost/latency (isolated to narration) | Specific model choice is an infra detail behind the port |
| **Jest / Vitest + Supertest** | Testing | Domain unit-testable with no I/O; Supertest for API/integration | — | — |
| **Docker + docker-compose** | Packaging/local run | One service + Postgres; +Redis container in V2 | — | — |
| **OpenAPI/Swagger** | API documentation | Deliverable + integration contract for consumers | — | — |

**Explicitly excluded (discussed and rejected):**
- **Vector database** — the LLM receives a complete structured object; nothing to embed or retrieve (ADR-006).
- **LangChain / LLM-orchestration** — a single structured call needs no orchestration framework; it would add dependency weight and blur the AI boundary (ADR-006).

---

## 10. Security Design

Right-sized to scope; enterprise mechanisms are named and deferred, not invented.

| Control | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **API keys** | Header-based API-key auth for consumers (MVP). OAuth2/OIDC is enterprise-scope, named in the Bible, not built here. |
| **Environment variables** | All provider/LLM keys and connection strings via env; `.env.example` committed, real `.env` git-ignored. |
| **Secrets management** | Env/secret file at MVP; no secrets in code or logs. |
| **Input validation** | Schema validation at the Interface boundary; reject malformed dates, out-of-range spans, and injection attempts before provider/DB access. |
| **Output validation** | LLM output confined to `narrative`, length-capped, treated as untrusted; contract validation on the intelligence object. |
| **Logging** | Structured logs with per-external-call outcomes; never log full prompts/responses that could contain user trip context; no secrets in logs. |
| **Rate limiting** | At the API layer — protects the service and upstream provider quotas; drives the 429 path. |
| **Error handling** | Standard envelope; internal exceptions never leak stack traces or provider detail to clients. |

**Structural security property worth noting:** because the LLM has no write path to any computed field, prompt-injection cannot alter a decision — it can at most affect the `narrative` string.

---

## 11. Performance & Scalability

### 11.1 Caching (see §7.4)
Two-level caching is the primary performance lever: provider-response caching protects quotas and cache-miss latency; computed-intelligence caching serves the hot path.

### 11.2 Provider optimization
- Fetch once per (location, date, freshness window); serve subsequent requests from the store.
- Fallback chain (V2) avoids blocking on a single slow provider.

### 11.3 Response-time strategy
- Cache-hit deterministic path: sub-second (in-memory arithmetic over a handful of days; p95 target < ~200 ms).
- Cache-miss: bounded by provider timeout + compute (paid once per freshness window).
- Narration latency (seconds, LLM-bound) is isolated to its own endpoint and cached (V2) — it never taxes the deterministic path.

### 11.4 Timeout handling
Every external call (provider, LLM) has a hard timeout feeding the fallback path; no request blocks indefinitely.

### 11.5 Concurrency
- Domain engines are pure and stateless → safe under concurrency with no shared mutable state.
- Contention is limited to the store/cache; connection pooling handles DB concurrency at MVP.

### 11.6 Graceful degradation
Stale-but-valid or fallback responses over failures (§12); the deterministic product remains available during an LLM outage by construction.

### 11.7 Future scalability (design-ready, not built)
Because engines are pure/stateless and infrastructure sits behind ports, the following are *additions, not rewrites*: Redis for shared cache, multiple stateless API instances behind a load balancer, scheduled/queued ingestion to absorb bursts, DB read replicas. The architecture shape does not change under load — that is the payoff of the layering (§15, ADR-003).

## 12. Error Handling Strategy

Decision table — every failure maps to a defined behavior; nothing crashes the request.

| Failure | Detection | Behaviour | Client result |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Provider failure / timeout** | typed provider error / timeout | advance fallback chain (V2); else use last-known stored data | 200 degraded, or 503 if no data |
| **AI narration failure** (disabled/timeout/error/malformed) | flag off / timeout / exception | deterministic templated narrative | 200, `fallbackUsed: true` |
| **Invalid request** | schema validation | reject before any I/O | 400 error envelope |
| **Timeout (any external)** | per-call timer | treat as failure → fallback | as per failing dependency |
| **Database failure** | repository exception | fail fast; if read-path and cache present, serve cached; else surface controlled error | 503/500 error envelope |
| **Unexpected exception** | global handler | log with context; return safe envelope (no internal leak) | 500 error envelope |

**Principles:** (1) deterministic endpoints never depend on the LLM; (2) every external dependency has a timeout and a defined fallback; (3) degraded ≠ failed — the response signals which via the `degraded`/`fallbackUsed` flags.

## 13. Testing Strategy

The domain is pure, so most coverage is cheap, fast, offline. (Full 11-type matrix in Bible §32; the six required here map to it.)

| Test type | Target | Method / assertion |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit** | Insight + Recommendation engines | pure, no I/O; table-driven cases (dry/storm/threshold-boundary); assert determinism (same input → same output). Highest coverage focus. |
| **Integration** | use case → repository → Postgres | test DB (container or transactional rollback); persistence + freshness behavior |
| **API** | endpoints | Supertest; status codes, response shape, error envelope, versioning |
| **Contract** | intelligence object | JSON-schema/contract test; build fails on a breaking change (protects consumers) |
| **Validation** | input + AI output | input: malformed params rejected at boundary; **AI-output: run narration over a fixed object, diff — only `narrative` may change** |
| **Regression** | engines + contract | golden-file expected intelligence for fixed inputs + ruleConfigVersion; any deviation fails |

The two highest-signal tests are **AI-output validation** (proves the boundary mechanically) and **fallback/degradation** (proves resilience). Coverage is concentrated on `domain/`, not on infrastructure glue.

## 14. Deployment Design

Only what the Bible defines — no Kubernetes, no cloud infra, no managed platform beyond a small PaaS.

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Runtime architecture** | Single containerized service + PostgreSQL. MVP is one deployable. |
| **Configuration** | Env-based; feature flags (notably narration on/off) via config; ruleConfig versioned. |
| **Environment variables** | Provider/LLM keys, DB connection, feature flags, timeouts. `.env.example` documents them; real values are never committed. |
| **Build process** | Standard Node build/compile; container image via Docker. |
| **Deployment workflow** | `docker-compose` for local/demo; a small PaaS (e.g., Fly.io / Railway / Render) for a hosted demo; HTTPS enforced. V2 adds a Redis container and a separately served static demo frontend. |
| **Runtime considerations** | Stateless service (state in Postgres/cache) → horizontally scalable later without redesign; single instance is the correct MVP footprint. |

## 15. Architectural Decisions (ADR)

Consolidated from Bible §36 and reframed as the implementation decision record. Each: Decision / Rationale / Alternatives / Trade-offs.

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives | Trade-offs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ADR-01** | **Deterministic intelligence** — all scores/ranks/recommendations from pure rule functions | Explainability, reproducibility, testability; the product must work with AI off | LLM-generated intelligence | More rule code up front; the payoff is auditability and offline tests |
| **ADR-02** | **AI isolation** — LLM narrates only, behind a port, in one use case, feature-flagged | Keeps the boundary enforceable and the deterministic product intact during LLM outage | LLM inside the Decision path | An extra interface + fallback path; worth it — it *is* the boundary |
| **ADR-03** | **Provider abstraction** — Strategy adapters + Factory registry | Swap/add providers without touching Application/Domain; prove abstraction with a 2nd provider | Hard-coded single provider | Slight indirection; enables fallback + extensibility |
| **ADR-04** | **Clean Architecture** — inward dependencies, pure domain | Domain must unit-test with no I/O; infrastructure swappable | Layer-free / framework-centric | Requires DI + a dependency-lint rule; enforced in CI |
| **ADR-05** | **Repository pattern** — Knowledge Store behind a port | Hide SQL from domain; single cross-plane boundary | Direct DB access in use cases | One abstraction layer; keeps domain pure |
| **ADR-06** | **REST APIs** | Simple, cacheable, universally consumable by a platform with only an HTTP client | GraphQL/RPC | Less flexible querying; unneeded at this scope |
| **ADR-07** | **URI versioning (`/v1`) from day one** | Cheap now; essential for a depended-on contract | Unversioned | Minor URL overhead; enables safe evolution |
| **ADR-08** | **Two-level caching; Postgres-as-cache at MVP, Redis in V2** | Don't add infra without a trigger; Postgres freshness suffices initially | Redis from day one | In-memory cache not shared across instances at MVP |
| **ADR-09** | **Two planes (Ingestion/Serving)** | Serving reads the store; not every request re-fetches — makes caching/resilience real | Single linear pipeline | A cache-miss trigger path in the Orchestrator |
| **ADR-10** | **Name `NarrationService`, not "Advisor"** | "Advisor" implies deciding, contradicting ADR-01/02; names leak into behavior | "Travel Advisor AI" | None; strengthens the boundary story |
| **ADR-11** | **No vector DB, no LangChain** | Nothing to retrieve/embed; one structured call needs no orchestration | Either/both | None at this scope; revisit only if narration becomes multi-step |
| **ADR-12** | ~~TypeScript/Node over FastAPI/Python~~ **— superseded (Implementation & Development Guide §1.6): Python/FastAPI is the approved stack; integration is over HTTP + OpenAPI, so no language seam exists** | Zero language seam into a TS platform (the success metric) | FastAPI/Python | Loses Python's validation/ML ergonomics |

## 16. Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Provider downtime / outage | Medium | Medium | Fallback chain (V2); last-known stored data; degraded 200; `providers/health` |
| Provider/API latency | Medium | Medium | Timeouts + two-level caching; fetch once per freshness window |
| AI narration failure | Low (isolated) | Medium | Optional, flagged; timeout + templated fallback; deterministic path unaffected |
| Cache staleness / wrong invalidation | Medium | Medium | TTL + `ruleConfigVersion`-based invalidation; freshness checks on read |
| Provider rate-limit / quota exhaustion | Medium | Medium | API-layer rate limiting + caching to minimize upstream calls |
| Non-determinism creeping into engines | High | Low | Determinism unit test; pure functions; no randomness/clock in domain |
| Boundary erosion (AI drifts into deciding) | Medium | Low | AI-output diff test; single-caller containment; `NarrationService` naming |
| Scalability beyond demo scale | Medium | Low (at scope) | Stateless engines + ports → Redis/replicas/queued ingestion are additions, not rewrites |
| Breaking the consumer contract | High | Low | Contract tests + URI versioning gate breaking changes |

## 17. Requirements Traceability Matrix

Each functional requirement (PRD §12) → technical component(s) → implementation module (Bible §19 structure) → test type (§13).

| FR | Requirement (short) | Technical component(s) | Implementation module | Testing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR-1 | Fetch provider weather | Provider Adapters, Provider Registry | `infrastructure/providers/*` | Provider-adapter, Integration |
| FR-2 | Normalize to internal model | Normalization Layer, Adapters | `infrastructure/providers/*`, normalization | Unit (normalization), Provider-adapter |
| FR-3 | Persist raw + computed | Knowledge Store | `infrastructure/persistence/*`, `domain/ports` | Integration, Database |
| FR-4 | Per-day intelligence | Insight Engine, Intelligence Builder | `domain/engines/insight`, `domain/entities` | Unit, Regression |
| FR-5 | Trip-level intelligence | Recommendation Engine, Builder | `domain/engines/recommendation`, `domain/entities` | Unit, Regression |
| FR-6 | Optional narration (no value change) | Narration Service, `GenerateNarrative` | `infrastructure/ai`, `application/use-cases` | Validation (AI-output), Fallback |
| FR-7 | Serve via stable versioned contract | REST API, Orchestrator, Builder | `interface/http`, `application/use-cases` | API, Contract |
| FR-8 | Avoid redundant provider calls | Caching (both levels), Knowledge Store | `infrastructure/cache`, persistence | Integration, Performance |
| FR-9 | Graceful degradation | Registry (fallback), Orchestrator, error handler | `infrastructure/providers`, `interface/http` | Fallback, Timeout, API |
| FR-10 | Report provider availability | Provider Registry, health endpoint | `infrastructure/providers`, `interface/http` | API, Integration |

**NFR anchors:** NFR-1 explainability → rule-id on every factor (Insight Engine, Regression test); NFR-2 determinism → pure engines (Unit/determinism test); NFR-3 resilience → §12 (Fallback/Timeout tests); NFR-4 AI isolation → single-caller containment + AI-output diff test; NFR-6 portability → REST contract + Contract test.
