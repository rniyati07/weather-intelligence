# Weather Intelligence Service — API & Data Contract Specification

> **Status note.** This contract covers the weather-intelligence endpoints (`/locations/...`, `/providers/health`) as originally specified. The conversational endpoints (`/conversations`, `/conversations/chat`) were added later and are **not** described here. The running service's own OpenAPI document (`/docs`, `/openapi.json`) is the authoritative, current contract; `docs/architecture/system-specification.md` describes the chat behaviour.

## 1. Document Information

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Document** | `docs/api/api-and-data-contract.md` |
| **Purpose** | Define the complete communication contract between API consumers and the backend. A frontend engineer should be able to integrate using only this document. |
| **Audience** | Frontend engineers, API consumers, backend developers, maintainers, integration partners (e.g., the future TravelOS planner). |
| **Version** | 1.0 |
| **Status** | Approved for implementation |
| **Dependencies** | Requires an issued API key (§3). Backend depends on external weather providers (§4), which are internal-only. |
| **Related documents** | `docs/architecture/system-architecture-original.md`, `docs/product/product-requirements.md`, `docs/architecture/technical-design.md` (all v1.0, approved — not modified or restated here). |

**Scope.** This document specifies only the API interface and data contracts: endpoints, request/response schemas, validation, authentication, errors, enumerations, versioning, and the internal provider integration layer. Product rationale, architecture, and testing live in the referenced documents and are not repeated.

**Conventions.**
- All examples use `application/json`.
- All dates are ISO-8601 calendar dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`); all timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`).
- Units are metric (§5).
- Field names are `camelCase`; enum values are `snake_case` or `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` as specified per enum (§10).

## 2. API Design Principles

| Principle | Contract implication |
|---|---|
| **RESTful design** | Resources are nouns (`locations`, `intelligence`, `providers`); HTTP verbs express intent (`GET` reads, `POST` triggers narration). |
| **Stateless communication** | Every request is self-contained and carries its own auth. No server-side session state; identical requests are independently serviceable. |
| **JSON payloads** | Requests and responses are JSON. `Content-Type: application/json` and `Accept: application/json`. |
| **Resource naming** | Hierarchical, plural collections: `/locations/{locationId}/intelligence`. Sub-resources for derived views (`/best-days`, `/packing`, `/narrative`). |
| **Consistent response format** | Every response — success or failure — uses one envelope (§6): `success`, `data`, `metadata`, `error`. |
| **Versioning** | Version in the URI path (`/api/v1`). See §12. |
| **Backward compatibility** | Additive changes only within a major version; new fields and new enum values are non-breaking (§12). |
| **Deterministic responses** | For identical inputs and the same `ruleConfigVersion`, all computed fields are identical. The optional `narrative` text is the only non-deterministic element, and it is served by a separate endpoint. |
| **Provider independence** | Responses never reveal which external provider supplied the underlying weather. Provider identity is an internal concern (§4). |

**API design philosophy.** The contract exposes *travel intelligence*, not raw meteorology and not implementation detail. Consumers depend on a stable, provider-agnostic shape; the backend is free to change providers, caching, or models without breaking clients, provided this contract holds.

---

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Authentication method** | API key (per-consumer), issued out of band. |
| **Authorization header** | `X-API-Key: <api_key>` on every request. (An API key identifies and authorizes the consumer; there are no per-user roles in v1.) |
| **Content-Type** | `application/json` (required on requests with a body). |
| **Accept** | `application/json` (recommended; JSON is returned regardless). |
| **Transport** | HTTPS required. Requests over plain HTTP are rejected. |
| **Security expectations** | Keys are secrets: never embed a key in frontend source shipped to end users. Browser clients must call through a backend-for-frontend or proxy that injects the key. Keys may be rotated; treat them as opaque. |
| **Missing/invalid key** | `401` with `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR` (§7). |
| **Key lacks access to a resource** | `403` with `AUTHORIZATION_ERROR` (reserved; not used for role logic in v1). |
| **Future authentication support** | OAuth2 / OIDC and per-tenant scoping are anticipated for a later enterprise version and will be additive (a new auth scheme alongside API keys), not a breaking replacement. |

---

## 4. External Provider Integrations (internal backend layer)

> **This section is for backend developers and maintainers only.** It documents internal implementation dependencies. **None of it appears in the public API contract.** Provider-specific request formats and response schemas are never exposed to API consumers, and no weather-data response reveals which provider was used.

The backend integrates four external weather services. Three supply **forecast/current** data; one supplies **historical/baseline** data. All are accessed behind a uniform internal `WeatherProvider` interface and normalized to one internal model before any processing.

### 4.1 Providers

#### 4.1.1 OpenWeather
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Purpose | Forecast and current conditions (forecast provider). |
| Base URL | `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5` |
| Authentication | API key passed as the `appid` query parameter. |
| API key requirement | **Required** (`OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`). |
| Supported features | Current conditions, short/medium-range forecast, temperature, precipitation, wind, condition codes. |
| Expected usage | Forecast-class fallback provider. |
| Known limitations | Free-tier request quotas and limited forecast horizon; quotas/pricing vary by plan — consult the provider's current documentation. |
| Internal normalization notes | Map OpenWeather numeric condition codes → internal `WeatherCondition`; convert to metric units; map fields to the internal reading model. |

#### 4.1.2 WeatherAPI
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Purpose | Forecast and current conditions (forecast provider). |
| Base URL | `http://api.weatherapi.com/v1` (HTTPS used in practice). |
| Authentication | API key passed as the `key` query parameter. |
| API key requirement | **Required** (`WEATHERAPI_KEY`). |
| Supported features | Current, forecast, and limited historical; condition text/codes, precipitation, wind. |
| Expected usage | Forecast-class fallback provider. |
| Known limitations | Free-tier call limits and reduced forecast days on lower tiers; consult current provider docs for quotas. |
| Internal normalization notes | Map WeatherAPI condition codes → internal `WeatherCondition`; normalize units and field names. |

#### 4.1.3 Open-Meteo
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Purpose | Forecast and current conditions (forecast provider). |
| Base URL | `https://api.open-meteo.com` |
| Authentication | **None** — no API key required for standard non-commercial use. |
| API key requirement | **Not required.** |
| Supported features | Current and multi-day forecast; temperature, precipitation probability, wind, WMO weather codes. |
| Expected usage | **Primary forecast provider** (no key, low friction). |
| Known limitations | Fair-use limits on the free endpoint; no per-consumer key means shared-quota behavior; historical data is served by a separate archive interface, not this base. |
| Internal normalization notes | Map WMO weather codes → internal `WeatherCondition`; data is already metric-friendly. |

#### 4.1.4 Meteostat
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Purpose | Historical and climate-baseline data (historical provider). |
| Base URL | `https://meteostat.net` (hosted API endpoint configured per environment). |
| Authentication | API key (hosted API). |
| API key requirement | **Required** (`METEOSTAT_API_KEY`). |
| Supported features | Historical daily/station observations and climate normals. |
| Expected usage | **Historical/baseline class only** — fuels typical-weather baselines and anomaly comparisons (a future capability). Not used for forward forecasts. |
| Known limitations | Not a real-time forecast source; station coverage and historical depth vary by location. |
| Internal normalization notes | Normalize historical observations to the same internal reading model; used for baseline comparison, never as a forecast fallback. |

### 4.2 Provider layer behavior

| Concern | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Provider Abstraction Layer** | All providers implement one internal `WeatherProvider` interface. Downstream processing sees only the normalized internal model — never a provider payload. |
| **Provider Registry** | Central registry holding each provider's adapter, data class (forecast vs historical), priority, active flag, and last health result. |
| **Provider Selection Strategy** | Select by **data class first** (forecast requests never route to the historical provider and vice-versa), then by **priority order**, then by **health**. |
| **Provider Priority** | Forecast order (default, configurable): Open-Meteo → OpenWeather → WeatherAPI. Historical: Meteostat. |
| **Fallback Strategy** | On a forecast provider failure/timeout, advance to the next forecast provider in priority order. If all forecast providers fail, serve last-known stored data (marked stale) or return a degraded response (§7). |
| **Timeout Handling** | Per-call hard timeout; on expiry the call is treated as a failure and fallback advances. No request blocks indefinitely. |
| **Retry Policy** | Minimal, bounded retry on transient network errors only; no retry on `4xx`. Retries do not stack with fallback (brief same-provider retry, then fall back). |
| **Response Normalization** | Every provider payload is validated and mapped to the internal reading model (units, condition vocabulary, field names) before persistence or computation. Field completeness after normalization informs downstream confidence scoring. |
| **Standard Error Mapping** | Provider errors map to internal error codes: upstream timeout → `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`; all providers exhausted → `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` / `SERVICE_DEGRADED`; provider `4xx`/auth issues are internal and never surfaced verbatim to consumers. |
| **Configuration** | API keys and priority/timeout/retry settings are environment-configured (`OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`, `WEATHERAPI_KEY`, `METEOSTAT_API_KEY`; Open-Meteo needs none). Priority order and timeouts are tunable without code changes. |

**Contract guarantee:** changing provider set, priority, or availability never changes the public response shape. Consumers cannot observe provider identity through any weather-data endpoint.

---

## 5. Common Request Standards

| Standard | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Base URL** | `https://{host}/api/v1` |
| **API version** | `v1` (in the path). See §12. |
| **Required headers** | `X-API-Key: <api_key>`; `Accept: application/json`. `Content-Type: application/json` on requests with a body. |
| **Content types** | Request and response bodies are `application/json`. |
| **Date format** | ISO-8601 calendar date `YYYY-MM-DD` for `startDate` / `endDate`. |
| **Timezone handling** | Date ranges are interpreted in the **location's local timezone** (weather is inherently local). Response timestamps (`generatedAt`) are UTC. |
| **Units** | Metric and fixed in v1: temperature °C, wind speed km/h, precipitation probability `0.0–1.0`, precipitation amount mm. (An optional imperial mode is a documented future extension; not active in v1.) |
| **Coordinate format** | Decimal degrees. Latitude `[-90, 90]`, longitude `[-180, 180]`. |
| **Location identifier** | `locationId` path parameter. In v1 it is a coordinate pair `"{lat},{lon}"` (URL-encoded), e.g. `15.2993,74.1240`. Resolving a place name to coordinates (geocoding) is a **client responsibility** and is outside this service's scope. |
| **Query parameters** | `startDate`, `endDate` (required on intelligence/raw endpoints). `language` (optional, narration only). |
| **Optional parameters** | Unknown query parameters are ignored, not rejected. |
| **Pagination** | Not applicable. Responses are bounded by the requested date range (§11 caps the range), so no pagination is defined in v1. |
| **Filtering** | Not applicable in v1. |
| **Sorting** | Not applicable. `dailyIntelligence` is always returned in ascending date order. |

---

## 6. Common Response Standards

Every response uses one envelope. Exactly one of `data` / `error` is populated; the other is `null`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `success` | boolean | `true` on a `2xx` outcome (including degraded success), `false` otherwise. |
| `data` | object \| null | The result payload on success; `null` on error. |
| `metadata` | object | Present on every response (§9, `Metadata`). Request-level, provider-agnostic. |
| `error` | object \| null | The error object (§7) on failure; `null` on success. |

**Success example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "...": "endpoint-specific payload" },
  "metadata": {
    "apiVersion": "1.0",
    "generatedAt": "2026-07-21T10:00:00Z",
    "requestId": "req_9f2c1a7b",
    "cacheStatus": "hit",
    "ruleConfigVersion": "2026.07",
    "degraded": false
  },
  "error": null
}
```

**Degraded success example** (valid data served despite a provider issue — note `success: true`, `degraded: true`):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "...": "intelligence built from last-known data" },
  "metadata": {
    "apiVersion": "1.0",
    "generatedAt": "2026-07-21T10:00:00Z",
    "requestId": "req_5b1d0e33",
    "cacheStatus": "stale",
    "ruleConfigVersion": "2026.07",
    "degraded": true
  },
  "error": null
}
```

**Error example:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "metadata": {
    "apiVersion": "1.0",
    "generatedAt": "2026-07-21T10:00:00Z",
    "requestId": "req_3a7e22c9"
  },
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "startDate must be on or before endDate.",
    "details": [
      { "field": "startDate", "issue": "startDate is after endDate" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 7. Error Contract

### 7.1 HTTP status codes

| Status | Meaning | `error.code` |
|---|---|---|
| `200 OK` | Success (including degraded success, with `metadata.degraded = true`). | — |
| `400 Bad Request` | Malformed or invalid parameters/body. | `VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing/invalid API key. | `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR` |
| `403 Forbidden` | Key not permitted for the resource (reserved). | `AUTHORIZATION_ERROR` |
| `404 Not Found` | Unknown route or unresolvable location. | `NOT_FOUND` |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Consumer rate limit exceeded. | `RATE_LIMITED` |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Unexpected server fault. | `INTERNAL_ERROR` |
| `503 Service Unavailable` | All weather providers unavailable and no usable stored data. | `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` / `SERVICE_DEGRADED` |

### 7.2 Standard error object

| Field | Type | Required | Nullable | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `code` | string (enum `ErrorCode`) | yes | no | Stable machine-readable error code. |
| `message` | string | yes | no | Human-readable summary. Safe to log; never contains internal/provider detail. |
| `details` | array<ErrorDetail> | no | yes | Field-level issues (chiefly for validation). |

**`ErrorDetail`:**
| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `field` | string | Offending parameter/field name. |
| `issue` | string | What is wrong with it. |

### 7.3 Error categories

| Category | Code | Typical cause | Client action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Validation | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | bad dates/coords/range | fix request; do not retry unchanged |
| Authentication | `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR` | missing/invalid key | fix credentials |
| Authorization | `AUTHORIZATION_ERROR` | key lacks access (reserved) | contact provider of key |
| Provider failure | `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` | all upstream providers down, no stored data | retry later with backoff |
| Timeout | `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` | upstream slow beyond timeout | retry with backoff |
| Rate limit | `RATE_LIMITED` | quota exceeded | honor `Retry-After`, back off |
| Degraded | `SERVICE_DEGRADED` | partial capability only | retry later; data may be stale |
| Internal | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | unexpected fault | retry once; then report `requestId` |

> Note: `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`, and `SERVICE_DEGRADED` describe *the service's* upstream state generically. They never name or expose a specific external provider.

---

## 8. REST API Specification

Base URL for all endpoints: `https://{host}/api/v1`. All endpoints require `X-API-Key`. Common headers and the response envelope (§6) apply to every endpoint and are not repeated per-endpoint.

### 8.1 Get Weather Intelligence

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Full deterministic weather intelligence (per-day + trip summary) for a location and date range. **No narration.** |
| **Method / Endpoint** | `GET /locations/{locationId}/intelligence` |
| **Authentication** | `X-API-Key` (required) |
| **Path params** | `locationId` — coordinate id `"{lat},{lon}"` |
| **Query params** | `startDate` (required, `YYYY-MM-DD`), `endDate` (required, `YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| **Request body** | none |

**Validation rules:** valid coordinate `locationId`; both dates present and well-formed; `startDate ≤ endDate`; range within limits (§11).
**Business rules:** `data.narrative` is always `null` on this endpoint (narration is a separate call). Computed fields are deterministic for the same inputs and `ruleConfigVersion`.

**Success response (`200`):** `data` = `WeatherIntelligence` (§9.1), `narrative = null`.

**Failure responses:** `400` invalid params; `401` bad key; `404` unresolvable location; `429` rate limited; `503` all providers down and no stored data.

**Example request:**
```http
GET /api/v1/locations/15.2993,74.1240/intelligence?startDate=2026-08-01&endDate=2026-08-05
Host: api.example.com
X-API-Key: sk_live_xxx
Accept: application/json
```

**Example success response:** see §13 (Successful Response).
**Example error response:** see §13 (Validation Error).

---

### 8.2 Get Best & Worst Days

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Trip-level best/worst day view (a projection of the trip summary). |
| **Method / Endpoint** | `GET /locations/{locationId}/intelligence/best-days` |
| **Auth / Headers** | `X-API-Key` |
| **Query params** | `startDate` (required), `endDate` (required) |
| **Request body** | none |

**Validation:** identical to §8.1.
**Business rules:** returns the ranking subset of the trip summary; derived from the same computation as §8.1.

**Success (`200`):** `data` = `BestDaysView` (§9.7).
**Failures:** as §8.1.

**Example request:**
```http
GET /api/v1/locations/15.2993,74.1240/intelligence/best-days?startDate=2026-08-01&endDate=2026-08-05
X-API-Key: sk_live_xxx
```

---

### 8.3 Get Packing Recommendations

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Aggregated trip packing list (a projection of the trip summary). |
| **Method / Endpoint** | `GET /locations/{locationId}/intelligence/packing` |
| **Auth / Headers** | `X-API-Key` |
| **Query params** | `startDate` (required), `endDate` (required) |
| **Request body** | none |

**Validation:** identical to §8.1.
**Success (`200`):** `data` = `PackingView` (§9.8).
**Failures:** as §8.1.

**Example request:**
```http
GET /api/v1/locations/15.2993,74.1240/intelligence/packing?startDate=2026-08-01&endDate=2026-08-05
X-API-Key: sk_live_xxx
```

---

### 8.4 Get Raw Weather (normalized)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Provider-normalized daily weather readings, without intelligence processing. |
| **Method / Endpoint** | `GET /locations/{locationId}/weather/raw` |
| **Auth / Headers** | `X-API-Key` |
| **Query params** | `startDate` (required), `endDate` (required) |
| **Request body** | none |

**Validation:** identical to §8.1.
**Business rules:** readings are the internal normalized model (§9.9). **No provider is identified.**
**Success (`200`):** `data` = `{ location, period, readings: RawWeatherReading[] }`.
**Failures:** as §8.1.

**Example request:**
```http
GET /api/v1/locations/15.2993,74.1240/weather/raw?startDate=2026-08-01&endDate=2026-08-05
X-API-Key: sk_live_xxx
```

---

### 8.5 Generate Narrative (optional AI narration)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Natural-language restatement of the deterministic intelligence for a location and range. Never alters computed values. |
| **Method / Endpoint** | `POST /locations/{locationId}/intelligence/narrative` |
| **Auth / Headers** | `X-API-Key`; `Content-Type: application/json` |
| **Path params** | `locationId` |
| **Request body** | `NarrativeRequest` (§9.10): `{ startDate, endDate, language? }` |

**Validation:** valid `locationId`; `startDate`/`endDate` present, well-formed, `startDate ≤ endDate`, within limits; `language` (optional) a supported code.
**Business rules:** the backend uses the deterministic intelligence for the given location/range and narrates it. If the AI layer is disabled, times out, or fails, a deterministic templated narrative is returned with `fallbackUsed = true`; the call still returns `200`. `narrative` is the only content produced here; no computed value is created or changed.

**Success (`200`):** `data` = `{ location, period, narrative }` where `narrative` is a `Narrative` object (§9.6).
**Failures:** `400` invalid body; `401` bad key; `404` unresolvable location; `429` rate limited. (AI failure does **not** produce an error — it produces a fallback narrative.)

**Example request:**
```http
POST /api/v1/locations/15.2993,74.1240/intelligence/narrative
X-API-Key: sk_live_xxx
Content-Type: application/json

{ "startDate": "2026-08-01", "endDate": "2026-08-05", "language": "en" }
```

**Example response / fallback example:** see §13 (AI Narration).

---

### 8.6 Provider Health (operational / maintainer endpoint)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Report upstream provider availability. **Operational endpoint for maintainers/operators**, not part of the provider-independent weather contract. It is the one endpoint that names providers, by design, for operators; it may be access-restricted. |
| **Method / Endpoint** | `GET /providers/health` |
| **Auth / Headers** | `X-API-Key` (operator key) |
| **Query params** | none |
| **Request body** | none |

**Success (`200`):** `data` = `{ providers: ProviderHealth[] }` (§9.11).
**Failures:** `401` bad key; `500` internal.

**Example request:**
```http
GET /api/v1/providers/health
X-API-Key: sk_ops_xxx
```

**Example success response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "providers": [
      { "provider": "open-meteo", "status": "available", "lastCheckedAt": "2026-07-21T09:59:00Z" },
      { "provider": "openweather", "status": "available", "lastCheckedAt": "2026-07-21T09:59:00Z" },
      { "provider": "weatherapi", "status": "degraded", "lastCheckedAt": "2026-07-21T09:58:30Z" },
      { "provider": "meteostat", "status": "available", "lastCheckedAt": "2026-07-21T09:55:00Z" }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": { "apiVersion": "1.0", "generatedAt": "2026-07-21T10:00:00Z", "requestId": "req_health_01" },
  "error": null
}
```

## 10. Enumerations

| Enum | Allowed values | Meaning / usage |
|---|---|---|
| **`RiskLevel`** | `low`, `moderate`, `high` | Severity of travel disruption/hazard. Used on `RiskAssessment.overallRiskLevel`, `TripSummary.overallRiskLevel`. |
| **`Severity`** | `low`, `moderate`, `high` | Severity of an individual `RiskFactor`. |
| **`TravelAdvisory`** | `proceed`, `caution`, `avoid` | Day-level guidance. Derived from day risk: `low → proceed`, `moderate → caution`, `high → avoid`. |
| **`ActivityCategory`** | `outdoor_sightseeing`, `beach`, `indoor_museum` | Fixed v1 set for suitability scoring. Config-defined; new categories are additive (§12). |
| **`RiskFactorType`** | `heat`, `cold`, `rain`, `storm`, `wind` | Category of a contributing risk factor (v1 taxonomy; config-defined, extensible additively). |
| **`WeatherCondition`** | `clear`, `partly_cloudy`, `cloudy`, `rain`, `heavy_rain`, `thunderstorm`, `snow`, `fog` | Normalized internal condition vocabulary (provider codes map into this set). |
| **`CacheStatus`** | `hit`, `miss`, `stale` | Freshness of the served data. |
| **`ProviderStatus`** | `available`, `degraded`, `unavailable`, `unknown` | Operational provider state (`/providers/health` only). `unknown` — added post-launch, additive per §12 — means never actually probed; distinct from `available`, which means "no recorded failure since it was last actually called." |
| **`ErrorCode`** | `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR`, `AUTHORIZATION_ERROR`, `NOT_FOUND`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`, `SERVICE_DEGRADED`, `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Machine-readable error codes (§7). |

**Consumer guidance:** treat all enums as **open** for forward compatibility — a client must tolerate an unrecognized value (e.g., a new `WeatherCondition`) without failing (§12, §15).

---

## 11. Validation Rules

| Rule | Specification | On violation |
|---|---|---|
| **Required fields** | `startDate`, `endDate` on intelligence/raw/narrative; `NarrativeRequest.startDate`/`endDate`. | `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| **Optional fields** | `language` (narrative). Unknown query params ignored. | — |
| **Coordinate validation** | `locationId` parses to `lat,lon`; `lat ∈ [-90, 90]`, `lon ∈ [-180, 180]`. | `400` (or `404` if unresolvable) |
| **Date validation** | ISO-8601 `YYYY-MM-DD`; real calendar dates. | `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| **Date range** | `startDate ≤ endDate`. | `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| **Range length** | Span within the maximum forecast horizon: up to **16 days** and not more than 16 days ahead of the current date (configurable). | `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| **Format validation** | Headers/body well-formed JSON; correct `Content-Type` on `POST`. | `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| **Language** | `language`, if present, is a supported code (`en` in v1). | `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| **Business validation** | Requested dates fall within the supported forecast window; historical-only ranges are not served by v1 forecast endpoints. | `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| **Cross-field validation** | `endDate ≥ startDate`; range length rule above; `tempMaxC ≥ tempMinC` holds in all emitted data. | `400` for inputs |

Validation occurs at the API boundary before any provider call or computation.

---

## 12. API Versioning

| Aspect | Policy |
|---|---|
| **Version strategy** | Major version in the URI path (`/api/v1`). `metadata.apiVersion` reports the precise contract version (e.g., `1.0`). |
| **Backward compatibility** | Within a major version, only additive changes: new endpoints, new optional fields, new enum values. Consumers must ignore unknown fields and tolerate unknown enum values. |
| **Breaking changes** | Removing/renaming a field, changing a type, changing required-ness, or altering semantics requires a new major version (`/api/v2`). |
| **Deprecation policy** | Deprecated elements are documented and announced ahead of removal; a superseding major version runs in parallel during the transition. |
| **Migration strategy** | New major versions are introduced side-by-side; consumers migrate by changing the path prefix; no silent behavior changes within a version. |

## 14. Data Lifecycle (conceptual)

High-level path of a request, from the consumer's perspective. This is a contract-level view, not an architecture description.

```
Client request (location + date range, API key)
   ->  REST API            : authenticate, validate, apply the response envelope
   ->  Weather Provider Layer (internal) : obtain data from an internal provider (or cache)
   ->  Normalization (internal)          : provider data mapped to one internal model
   ->  Weather Intelligence Processing   : deterministic risk / suitability / packing / best-worst
   ->  AI Narration (optional, separate call) : plain-language restatement, never alters values
   ->  Standardized JSON response (envelope: success / data / metadata / error)
```

Key contract facts implied by this flow:
1. The deterministic response (§8.1–8.4) is produced without the AI step; narration (§8.5) is a separate request.
2. Provider selection, caching, and normalization are invisible to the consumer; only the standardized payload is returned.
3. `metadata.cacheStatus` and `metadata.degraded` are the only signals a consumer receives about how the data was sourced — never a provider identity.

---

## 15. Consumer Integration Guidelines

| Topic | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Retries** | Retry only on `429`, `503`, `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`, and `INTERNAL_ERROR`, using exponential backoff with jitter. Never retry `400`/`401`/`403`/`404` unchanged. |
| **Caching** | Deterministic responses are cacheable client-side, keyed on `(locationId, startDate, endDate, ruleConfigVersion)`. Invalidate when `ruleConfigVersion` changes. Do not cache error responses. |
| **Timeouts** | Set a client timeout comfortably above typical deterministic latency. The narration endpoint (§8.5) is slower; allow a larger timeout for it specifically. |
| **Rate limits** | On `429`, honor the `Retry-After` header and back off. Batch and cache to stay within quota. |
| **Idempotency** | All `GET` endpoints are idempotent and safe to repeat. `POST /narrative` is not a data mutation; it may be retried, and identical inputs yield equivalent narration (subject to model/fallback state). |
| **Degraded handling** | Treat `success: true` with `metadata.degraded: true` (or `cacheStatus: "stale"`) as usable but possibly stale; consider a soft refresh later. |
| **Enum tolerance** | Tolerate unknown enum values (e.g., a new `WeatherCondition` or `ActivityCategory`) without failing — render a sensible default. |
| **Narration optionality** | Never make core UX depend on the AI narrative. Always render the deterministic data first; treat `narrative` as an enhancement, and handle `fallbackUsed: true` gracefully. |
| **Error recovery** | Surface `error.message` to users only when appropriate; log `error.code` and `metadata.requestId` for support. Use `requestId` when reporting an issue. |
| **Best practices** | Send `startDate`/`endDate` within the supported window; geocode place names client-side before calling; keep API keys server-side; depend only on documented fields. |

## 16. Appendix

### 16.1 Glossary
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Weather Intelligence | Deterministic travel guidance derived from weather: risk, activity suitability, packing, timing (per-day + trip). |
| Deterministic response | Output identical for identical inputs and the same `ruleConfigVersion`. |
| Narration | Optional AI-generated natural-language restatement of intelligence; never alters computed values. |
| Fallback (narration) | Deterministic templated narrative returned when the AI layer is unavailable (`fallbackUsed: true`). |
| Degraded response | Valid data served in a reduced mode (e.g., stale or provider-fallback), flagged via `metadata.degraded`. |
| Provider independence | Guarantee that no weather-data response reveals which external provider supplied the data. |
| Rule config version | Identifier of the deterministic rule set behind computed values; drives cache invalidation. |
| Travel confidence | `0.0–1.0` indicator of how much to trust an assessment (forecast horizon, source agreement, data completeness). |
| locationId | Canonical location identifier; a `lat,lon` coordinate pair in v1. |

### 16.4 Useful Notes
- This document governs the **public contract only**. Internal provider details (§4) are informational for maintainers and never leak into responses.
- All computed values are deterministic; only `narrative.summaryText` varies, and only via the separate narration endpoint.
- Forward compatibility depends on consumers ignoring unknown fields and tolerating unknown enum values.
- Units, coordinate format, and the `locationId` scheme are fixed for v1; changes to any of these would be a new major version.
