"""`TripContext` and `GeocodedPlace` — what the assistant knows about a trip.

`TripContext` is the whole answer to "must the user repeat themselves?". It
accumulates across conversation turns: each message contributes whatever it
reveals, and the context reports what is still missing so the orchestrator can
ask rather than guess.

Frozen and merged-by-copy like every other domain entity, so a later turn can
never mutate the context an earlier one observed. Framework-free per guide
§3.2 — no pydantic, no ORM, no HTTP; the interface layer aliases these to
camelCase, exactly as it does for `WeatherIntelligence`.

Deliberately holds no validation: `end >= start`, the forecast horizon, and
the no-history rule all live in `interface/http/dependencies.validate_date_range`
and stay there, so there is one date-rule implementation rather than two.
