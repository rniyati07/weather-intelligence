"""Overpass (OpenStreetMap) places adapter.

Keyless, per the approved decision — matches the same "no second secret"
reasoning already applied to Open-Meteo weather and geocoding. Bounded
`around:` queries only; this module never issues an unbounded regional query.

Reuses `providers.base.call_with_retry` and the generic `PROVIDER_*` settings
(timeout, retry attempts, backoff) rather than adding Overpass-specific
config — those settings were never weather-specific in name, only in current
usage.

#: Public Overpass instance(s), tried in order.
#:
#: A second host (`overpass.kumi.systems`) was carried here as a fallback for
#: the main instance's intermittent `504 Gateway Timeout` under load. Measured
#: independently it was unreachable — `ReadTimeout` after 40.5s against a 1.1s
#: primary response — and production logs showed both hosts failing together
#: on every occurrence, meaning it never once rescued a request. It only added
#: up to ~40s of latency to every turn where the primary failed, so it has
#: been removed rather than kept as dead weight. The fallback *mechanism*
#: (`for url in _INTERPRETER_URLS`, below) stays, in case a verified-reachable
#: second instance is added later.

#: Overpass's own execution budget, embedded in the query itself.
#:
#: Kept at or below the client's own timeout on purpose. Asking the server for
#: a 25s budget while the client gives up at `PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (5s)
#: meant a heavier multi-tag query — the kind a trip with several interests
#: produces — was still being computed server-side long after we had stopped
#: waiting, so it surfaced as "no places for this trip" rather than as a
#: timeout anyone could see. Overpass also schedules a query against the
#: budget it is given, so a smaller one is admitted sooner.
