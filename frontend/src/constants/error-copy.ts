/**
 * Error-code → user-facing copy — FDS §13.2.
 *
 * The API's own `error.message` is never rendered: it is written for a
 * developer reading a log, not for a traveller deciding whether to retry. Every
 * entry here says in plain language what happened and what to do next, and
 * names no provider, no stack, no internal detail.
 *
 * `scope` is what a component reads to decide *where* to render the failure.
 * `card` scope exists for exactly one case and it is the most important
 * integration rule in the design: narration failing must never blank the
 * dashboard (FDS §7.2, §13.3).
